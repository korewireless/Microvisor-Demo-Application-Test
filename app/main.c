        the appropriate peripheral bus, and are able to return date and trigger interrupts
        under simulated conditions.

        `mvTestingComplete()` and pass in zero (`0`) to indicate that the tests passed, or
        any non-zero value to indicate that the one or more of the tests failed.

        **IMPORTANT**
        `mvTestingComplete()` will only operate in code running within a factory environment.
        In all other cases, it will throw.
