        In a real application test, your code will proceed to test the hardware components

        the appropriate peripheral bus, and are able to return date and trigger interrupts
        under simulated conditions.

        When all your tests are complete, your code should call the Microvisor System Call
        `mvTestingComplete()` and pass in zero (`0`) to indicate that the tests passed, or
        any non-zero value to indicate that the one or more of the tests failed.

        **IMPORTANT**
        `mvTestingComplete()` will only operate in code running within a factory environment.
        In all other cases, it will return `MV_STATUS_UNAVAILABLE`.
